How to Become an Expert?
To reach an expert level, you need to:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Build Real-World Projects (TypeScript with React, Next.js, Express.js).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Dive into Advanced Topics (Utility Types, Type Narrowing, Mapped Types).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Read TypeScript Documentation (TS Handbook, DefinitelyTyped).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Work on Open Source Projects (Contribute to GitHub projects).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Solve TypeScript Challenges (LeetCode, CodeWars, Type Challenges).
6Ô∏è‚É£ Teach or Write About TypeScript (Blogging, Tutorials).



How Long to Become an Expert?
‚è≥ With daily practice (2-3 hours), you can reach an expert level in about 2-3 months.

üí° Bottom Line: After this routine, you'll be job-ready for TypeScript-based projects, but to become an expert, keep practicing and building projects! üöÄ
